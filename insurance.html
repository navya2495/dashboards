    <h1>Predictive Factors of Insurance Charges</h1>
    <p>Analysis and Predictive Modeling using US Health Insurance Dataset</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project aims to understand the key factors influencing insurance charges and evaluate how effectively these factors can be utilized for predicting insurance premiums. Using the US Health Insurance Dataset, predictive models were built to estimate individual medical costs.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
    <p>The dataset contains 1338 observations and 7 columns, with the following variables:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>age</strong>: Age of primary beneficiary</li>
      <li><strong>sex</strong>: Gender of the insurance contractor (male or female)</li>
      <li><strong>bmi</strong>: Body Mass Index (kg/m²), ideally between 18.5 to 24.9</li>
      <li><strong>children</strong>: Number of dependents covered by insurance</li>
      <li><strong>smoker</strong>: Smoker status (yes/no)</li>
      <li><strong>region</strong>: Residential area within the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest)</li>
      <li><strong>charges</strong>: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Preprocessing Steps</h2>
    <p>Before splitting the dataset, the following preprocessing steps were performed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Checked for missing values to ensure data completeness</li>
      <li>Examined the structure of the dataset to understand variable types and distributions</li>
      <li>Converted character data types (e.g., smoker, region) to categorical (factor) types</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These steps ensured that the dataset was clean and ready for analysis and modeling.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Statistical Learning Strategies and Methods</h2>
    <p>
      Using the training set, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand relationships between predictors and the target variable (charges). Feature creation and selection processes were applied to improve model performance. The step-by-step approach included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visualizing distributions and relationships (e.g., smoker vs. charges)</li>
      <li>Assessing correlations among numeric variables</li>
      <li>Creating new features if necessary</li>
      <li>Selecting the most relevant features for modeling</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Predictive Analysis and Results</h2>
    <p>
      Predictive modeling was performed using:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Linear Regression</strong>: To assess the linear relationship between predictors and charges</li>
      <li><strong>Random Forest</strong>: To capture complex nonlinear patterns and interactions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Cross-validation was used as a resampling method to evaluate model performance and avoid overfitting. The final models were assessed on the test data, comparing predicted insurance charges against actual charges.
    </p>
  </section>

 <section>
  <h2>Splitting the Dataset</h2>
  <p>
    To ensure reproducibility of the results, <code>set.seed(123)</code> was used. This ensures that each time the data is split, the same training and testing sets are produced, making the results consistent across runs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>createDataPartition</code> function from the <strong>caret</strong> package was used to split the data into training and testing sets:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Training set:</strong> 80% of the data (p = 0.8) used to train the model</li>
    <li><strong>Testing set:</strong> 20% of the data used to evaluate model performance</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After splitting, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection were performed on the training data to prepare it for modeling.

    <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
    <p>
      EDA was performed on the training set to understand the relationships between variables and the target variable <strong>charges</strong>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>age vs bmi:</strong> As age increases, there is a tendency for BMI values to increase as well, though the pattern is quite scattered.</p>
    <p><strong>age vs children:</strong> The number of children tends to rise with increasing age up to a certain point, then decreases at older ages.</p>
    <p><strong>age vs charges:</strong> As age goes up, charges generally tend to be higher though there is substantial spread or variation in the data.</p>
    <p><strong>bmi vs children:</strong> The relationship between BMI and children count appears relatively weak or non-existent, with children counts scattered across the range of BMI values.</p>
    <p><strong>bmi vs charges:</strong> Higher BMI values tend to have higher associated charges, but there is significant variability or spread in the charges across different BMI levels.</p>
    <p><strong>children vs charges:</strong> The plot indicates a subtle positive association between the number of children and charges, suggesting that individuals with more children tend to have slightly higher charges. However, this relationship is not strongly related.</p>
    <p>From this, visually exploring the relationships between multiple variables in a dataset helps to understand what might affect how much people pay for insurance. Age and BMI appear to be associated with higher charges while the relationship between the number of children and charges is less clear.</p>

    <h3>Boxplots for Qualitative Variables</h3>
    <p>
      Boxplots were created to examine the relationship between qualitative predictor variables (e.g., <strong>sex</strong>, <strong>smoker</strong>, <strong>region</strong>) and the response variable (<strong>charges</strong>).
    </p>
    <p><strong>charges vs sex:</strong> It seems that the median charge for females is lower than that for males. This is shown by the horizontal lines inside the boxes. Moreover, the charges for females appear to be more tightly packed and less spread out compared to males.</p>
    <p><strong>charges vs region:</strong> Looking at the boxes, it seems that the median charges are highest for the southwest region and lowest for the northwest region.</p>
    <p><strong>charges vs smoker:</strong> The horizontal line within the box represents the median charge for non-smokers. This tells us that smokers tend to have higher medical charges overall.</p>
    <p>
      This visual analysis helps identify differences in charges across categories and supports feature selection for modeling.

    <h3>Correlation Matrix</h3>
    <p>
      A correlation matrix was computed for numerical columns in the training set using:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
numerical_trainData <- trainData[, sapply(trainData, is.numeric)]
cor_matrix <- cor(numerical_trainData, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
print(cor_matrix)
    </code></pre>
    <p>Resulting correlation matrix:</p>
    <pre><code>
               age         bmi    children     charges
    age      1.0000     0.1186     0.0520      0.2886
    bmi      0.1186     1.0000     0.0230      0.1981
    children 0.0520     0.0230     1.0000      0.0559
    charges  0.2886     0.1981     0.0559      1.0000
    </code></pre>
  </div>
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <h3>Interpretation of Correlations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Age and BMI:</strong> Weak positive correlation (0.1186). Slight tendency for BMI to increase with age, but not strong.</li>
      <li><strong>Age and Children:</strong> Very weak positive correlation (0.0520). Slight tendency for older individuals to have more children, but the relationship is minimal.</li>
      <li><strong>Age and Charges:</strong> Moderate positive correlation (0.2886). As age increases, medical charges tend to increase moderately.</li>
      <li><strong>BMI and Children:</strong> Very weak positive correlation (0.0230). Little to no association.</li>
      <li><strong>BMI and Charges:</strong> Moderate positive correlation (0.1981). Higher BMI is associated with moderately higher charges.</li>
      <li><strong>Children and Charges:</strong> Weak positive correlation (0.0559). Having more children is associated with slightly higher charges, but the relationship is not strong.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Overall, EDA reveals that <strong>age</strong>, <strong>BMI</strong>, and <strong>smoker status</strong> (based on boxplots) are likely important predictors for modeling insurance charges, while <strong>number of children</strong> shows only a weak association.

  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <h3>Forward Stepwise Selection</h3>
    <p>
      Forward stepwise selection was used to identify the best subset of predictors for predicting <strong>charges</strong>. The predictors considered were: <em>age, bmi, children, sex_female, smoker_yes, region_southeast, region_northwest, region_northeast</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>regsubsets()</code> function was used to perform the selection, evaluating models based on <strong>Mallows' Cp</strong>, <strong>BIC</strong>, and <strong>Adjusted R²</strong>. The plots show:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cp:</strong> Selected 5 variables</li>
      <li><strong>BIC:</strong> Selected 4 variables</li>
      <li><strong>Adjusted R²:</strong> Selected 6 variables</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Best model based on Cp:</strong><br>
      Intercept: -11950.60<br>
      Age: 247.53<br>
      BMI: 320.99<br>
      Children: 442.42<br>
      Smoker_Yes: 24225.20<br>
      Region_Northeast: 843.07
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interpretation:</strong><br>
      - <strong>Age:</strong> Each additional year increases charges by $247.53.<br>
      - <strong>BMI:</strong> Each unit increase in BMI raises charges by $320.99.<br>
      - <strong>Children:</strong> Each child adds $442.42 to charges.<br>
      - <strong>Smoker:</strong> Smokers pay $24,225.20 more on average.<br>
      - <strong>Region (Northeast):</strong> Individuals from this region pay $843.07 more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cp model balances accuracy and simplicity, making it a strong candidate for predicting insurance charges.

  <h3>Applicability of Statistical Learning Methods</h3>
  <p>
    Based on forward stepwise selection and exploratory data analysis, several predictors show strong potential for modeling insurance charges using statistical learning methods like linear regression.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Positively correlated with charges. As individuals age, their medical expenses tend to rise. This relationship is linear and suitable for linear regression.</li>
    <li><strong>BMI:</strong> Higher BMI values are associated with increased charges. The linear trend supports its use in linear regression models.</li>
    <li><strong>Number of Children:</strong> Shows a weak positive correlation. While linear regression can model this, the relationship may not be strictly linear.</li>
    <li><strong>Smoking Status:</strong> A strong predictor. Smokers incur significantly higher charges, making this a critical variable in any predictive model.</li>
    <li><strong>Region:</strong> Individuals from the Northeast region tend to have slightly higher charges. Though the effect is smaller, it still contributes to model accuracy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Linear regression is applicable for predicting insurance charges using these variables, as they generally satisfy assumptions of linearity and independence. However, for capturing more complex, non-linear interactions, advanced models like <em>Random Forest</em> may offer improved performance.

  <h3>Model Evaluation and Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    Based on cross-validation metrics, the <strong>Linear Regression model</strong> explains approximately <strong>75%</strong> of the variability in insurance charges. However, the <strong>Test R-squared</strong> of <strong>0.71</strong> and noticeable differences between predicted and actual values indicate some prediction errors and variability.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Random Forest model</strong> outperforms linear regression with a <strong>lower RMSE (4911.24)</strong>, <strong>lower MAE (2770.33)</strong>, and a <strong>higher R-squared (0.824)</strong>. This suggests better accuracy and a closer fit to the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    The optimal number of predictors per split in the Random Forest model is <strong>2</strong>, indicating that setting <code>mtry = 2</code> yields the best performance.
  </p>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Key predictors identified: <strong>age, BMI, children, smoker_yes, region_northeast</strong>.</li>
    <li>Random Forest is more robust and generalizes better than Linear Regression.</li>
    <li>Model evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²) support the superiority of Random Forest for this task.</li>
    <li>These models can help insurers understand and explain premium calculations and offer personalized recommendations.</li>
    <li>Limitations include a restricted set of predictors and potential unaddressed outliers or non-linear relationships.</li>
    <li>Future improvements could involve adding more features, handling outliers, and using advanced techniques like polynomial or spline regression.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This analysis provides valuable insights for insurance companies to refine pricing strategies and enhance customer engagement by understanding the key drivers of insurance charges.
