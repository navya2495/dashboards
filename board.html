    <h2>ðŸ“– Storytelling Behind the Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
      This Power BI dashboard was developed to uncover sales trends, profitability drivers,
      and regional performance over a four-year period. By integrating data from orders,
      customer segments, and regional managers, we aimed to support business leaders in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identifying high-performing product categories and regions</li>
      <li>Understanding where profits are concentrated or declining</li>
      <li>Pinpointing underperforming sub-categories for review</li>
      <li>Empowering regional managers with actionable insights</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For example, the dashboard shows that <strong>Phones</strong> and <strong>Chairs</strong> consistently lead in sales,
      while categories like <strong>Labels</strong> and <strong>Art</strong> struggle. This helps stakeholders realign marketing,
      inventory, and strategic planning efforts.

  <h2>ðŸ“… Slicer Selected: Year 2014 â€“ Deep Dive</h2>
  <p>
    When the slicer is set to <strong>2014</strong>, the dashboard filters all visualizations to show only sales and profit data for that year.
    Hereâ€™s what we observe in the visuals and what it means for decision-makers:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sales by Region:</strong> The <em>West</em> region leads in total sales, followed by <em>East</em> and <em>South Central</em>. This indicates stronger market presence in western territories.</li>
    <li><strong>Top Cities:</strong> <em>New York City</em>, <em>San Francisco</em>, and <em>Los Angeles</em> dominate in urban sales. These cities should be prioritized for marketing and supply chain focus.</li>
    <li><strong>Top Sub-Categories:</strong> Products like <em>Phones</em>, <em>Chairs</em>, and <em>Machines</em> show the highest sales. These sub-categories are key revenue drivers and candidates for upselling strategies.</li>
    <li><strong>Bottom Sub-Categories:</strong> Items like <em>Copiers</em>, <em>Labels</em>, and <em>Envelopes</em> show minimal sales. These may need reevaluation or bundling offers to increase performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Segment Analysis:</strong> The <em>Consumer</em> segment dominates, suggesting that B2C strategies are working well. However, <em>Corporate</em> and <em>Home Office</em> segments may have growth potential.</li>
    <li><strong>Profit by Region:</strong> Profit margins are highest in the <em>West</em> region, followed by <em>East</em>, with very low profit in <em>Central</em>. This raises red flags for cost control and margin improvement in Central.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    ðŸ“Œ <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The year 2014 revealed strong sales in western urban areas driven by tech and office supplies. The business can capitalize on this by investing more in regional campaigns, managing inventory for best-selling products, and reviewing underperforming categories.
